Hello, I'm Matheus Silverio ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I showcase my skills and projects as a front-end engineer with expertise in React, TypeScript, and Next.js. I'm passionate about crafting engaging user experiences and building scalable and performant web applications.

About Me
I am a dedicated front-end engineer with 4 years of experience in the industry. Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, ranging from small-scale applications to large enterprise solutions. My focus lies in leveraging the latest web technologies to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.

Skills
React: I have extensive experience working with React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I leverage React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM to create reusable and maintainable code.

TypeScript: I am proficient in TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript brings static typing to JavaScript, enabling enhanced code quality, better documentation, and improved developer tooling.

Next.js: I have hands-on experience with Next.js, a popular React framework. By utilizing Next.js, I can achieve server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for improved performance and SEO.

HTML5 & CSS3: I have a strong foundation in HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring clean and semantically structured markup. I am skilled in creating responsive layouts and utilizing CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

Selenium: Browser automation and frontend testing

Version Control: I am proficient in Git, enabling efficient collaboration and version control. I am comfortable working with GitHub, ensuring seamless code management and project collaboration.

Projects
Here are some of the noteworthy projects I have worked on:

The men's: A responsive e-commerce website built with React and Redux. It features a dynamic product catalog, shopping cart functionality, and user authentication.

Portal - (pillot admin interface): An interactive dashboard application developed with Next.js and TypeScript. It integrates with an API to display real-time data visualizations and provides a user-friendly interface for data analysis.

webscrapping: Series of scripts to scrap some data from browser pages with selenium
